== Architecture Decisions

=== Use a single binary crate

Since the project is small and self-contained, using a single binary crate is enough. In the future, it could still be migrated to using a binary+library crate.

=== Use an IR

It would be simpler to simply walk over the AST during interpretation, but this presents several problems:

* The AST is more permissive than the language, therefore it would have to be checked at runtime.

* The AST is not optimized for interpretation efficiency, because it's not cache efficient.

* There would still have to be a second pass over the AST to resolve labels.

Therefore, an IR is used to resolve the labels and interpret it.
