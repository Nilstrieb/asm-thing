The interpreter follows a classic interpreter architecture. First, the source is tokenized by a lexer, implemented using the `logos` library (https://crates.io/crates/logos).

Then, a handwritten recursive descent parser parses the token stream. The abstract syntax tree is then given to a small compiler, that compiles it down to a smaller and more limited IR. It also resolves jump labels to offsets.

The interpreter then executes this lower level IR.
