== Solution Strategy

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Quality Goal|Approaches
|Ease of implementation| Simple language with not too many features. Many features out of scope, like static data.
|Interpreter UX|Keeping track of source locations throughout the compilation/interpretation process, usage of the crate `ariadne` (https://crates.io/crates/ariadne) for displaying diagnostics.
|Performance|Written in a native compiled language (Rust). Internally, the AST is compiled into a lower level IR, where jump labels are resolved to instruction offsets, and span information is kept separately to improve cache locality.
