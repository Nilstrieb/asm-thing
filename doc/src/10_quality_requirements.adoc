|ID|Scenario
|1|A developer wants to add a new feature to the parser. It should be ensured that they don't break existing functionality.
|2|A new developer that is already familiar with rust wants to get started contributing to the project. The project should be familiar to them.
|3|Someone wants to use crapderive, but they have syntax errors since they aren't familiar with the language yet. The compiler should help them find the issues and fix them.
