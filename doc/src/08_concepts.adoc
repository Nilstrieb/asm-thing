== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== Version control

This project uses git and Github for version control.

=== Error handling

A single type is used for handling invalid input. The error has a single message, a span that shows the location in the source code, and optionally some notes or a help message. This message is then printed using the `ariadne` crate.

[source,rust]
----
include::{sourcedir}/error.rs[tag=error]
----

If the interpreter enters an invalid state, it panics.

=== Unsafe code

Currently, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is used in the crate, but unsafe code may be used for performance improvements in the future.
