== Risks and Technical Debts

=== Cannot do IO

Due to time constraints, IO features might not be implemented.

==== Mitigations

Don't tell anyone.

==== Avoidance

Prioritize IO features highly.

=== The interpreter won't compile

The Rust compiler is very strict, making to possible for the interpreter to not compile.

==== Mitigations

Comment out the offending code. In the worse case, abuse https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/98608.

==== Avoidance

Don't write code that doesn't compile. Follow the Rust borrowing rules.
